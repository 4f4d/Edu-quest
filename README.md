# EduQuest

EduQuest is a turn-based combat game that gamifies the learning experience.  
This repository currently focuses on the core logic and the frontend of the game.

This is part of **Smart India Hackathon 2025** problem - **SIH25048 (Gamified Learning Platform for Rural Education)**.  
The full solution requires additional components that will be added later to this repository.
